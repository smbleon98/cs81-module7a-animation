        HTML tag type specified in "loader" variable, which was the text "Loading...".
        This creates a direct access to that HTML content.
        That "Loading..." text is replaced by the frame/screen chosen at the right of the =.
        This is how the DOM is updated.
        index % frames.length because uses the remainder of the (index / 5), which will be between 0 and 5,
        to show the next frame. Because index is increasing by 1, while frames.length stays the same,
        the frame will just move by one index, so timer empty, timer full, ., .., ....
        If the remainder is 0, then one full cycle of waiting has been complete,
        and you increase the cycleCount until you reach the max number of cycles, which is 10,
        at which point, you no longer load the 'loading' frames and instead load the green checkmark.  
        This frame is changed for every half second, given the '500' ms argument.
