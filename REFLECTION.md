1. What part of the code was most confusing and why?
- I did not recognize setInterval and clearInterval, so I had to Google these commands.
This helped me realize that setInterval was a special command that operated in a loop
without using the conventional 'for' or 'while' loop commands that we're used to.
Similarly, I didn't understand 'clearInterval''s purpose until I Googled it, 
and I understood why we did not see the typical 'break' statement or a similar keyword.

2. How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
- This week's topics were the most difficult of the whole course for me. I appreciate that 
the animation was very simple. Because of its simplicity, I tried to guess what some of the code might have been before looking at it. I'm still stuck in my 'procedural programming' / synchronous programming mindset, so, having my guess of what that was gave me a point of reference / comparison for these new programming commands. It made the new concepts digestible and manageable. However, because of the repeatability of the frames, this code did not feel asyncrhonous to me in the way that some of the external examples on Youtube (like with setTimeout) and in the textbook chapter were; for example, it felt like this was 'for' loop in action, and the aspect of it that gave it some 'asynchronous' flavor was the timing between frame changes.

3. What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
- Because of my end user experience of initially not knowing that the spinner was actually finite, I added a marker that indicated at what interval the spinner was. It had a positive effect because it gave me an idea of how long I should stick around at the screen for. Not providing some sort of feedback to the end user could lead them to give up on the application and generate bad reviews.
